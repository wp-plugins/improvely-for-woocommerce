Add Improvely to your WooCommerce-powered store to see where every purchase came from, and prevent PPC click fraud.

== Description ==

* Measure your advertising, social media marketing and SEO results.
* Identify the source of every purchase - what sites, searches, ads and keywords bring customers to your shop.
* Track the costs, revenue and profit from all your online advertising on Google AdWords, Microsoft AdCenter, Facebook, and everywhere else you advertise.

Improvely makes you a smarter store owner. You'll know exactly how each of your new customers found your store without asking them - the specific website link they clicked, search they typed into Google, or ad they clicked to get to your site. All you need is WooCommerce, an Improvely account and about 60 seconds...

**Your Marketing Performance Dashboard**

Improvely keeps track of the source of every visit to your store - external links, web searches, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, and any advertising you're doing. When someone makes a purchase, you'll get an e-mail telling you exactly how your new customer found your site.

Plus, you'll get over 30 online reports detailing the performance of all your traffic sources - how many unique people and visits they've sent you, how many people from that source have made a purchase, your visitor-to-customer conversion rate, and more. You can slice and dice all your web traffic by all these dimensions:

* Landing page
* Search engine
* Search phrase
* Referring URL or domain name
* Country, state and city
* Day of week and time of day
* Ad campaign name
* Advertising medium (banner, PPC, e-mail, etc)

**Measure Your Advertising Results**

If you pay to advertise your WooCommerce store online, Improvely can track all your advertising results. You'll see the cost, revenue generated, cost-per-acquisition and profit for each marketing campaign you run - plus you can drill down to individual ads, landing pages, keywords, locations and more to see which are bringing you new customers and which are wasting your money.

**Pricing & Plans**

Improvely is free for 14 days so that you have a chance to try it out and decide which monthly plan best meets your needs. Our plans range from $29 to $299 per month depending on how many visitors your shop receives each month.
